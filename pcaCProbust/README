I made an experimental "robust PCA" by using 8 of the block PCA features and all of the 9 features 
(to identify a copied region) as in these papers:

Naisbitt, M.B. (2016). Overlapping Block Based Algorithm for Copy-Move Forgery Detection in Digital Images.

Lin, Hwei-Jen & Wang, Chun-Wei & Kao, Yang-Ta. (2009). Fast copy-move forgery detection. 
WSEAS Transactions on Signal Processing. 5. 188-197. 

(This method work the best so far! :))

Remember (just like in other 2 algorithms): 
Nf is the frequency (total number) of the blocks in the offset copied region
Nd is the minumum offset of the copied region to be detected

Use Nf <- 8, Nd <-200, boxside <- 32
