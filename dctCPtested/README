There are two example codes in the folder (within this folder) called "code" which already have specified the input 
parameters (also below) to black out copied regions for the test image "001_F.jpg" (also included in the folder).

Use Q <- 49, Nf <- 4, Nd <- 128  (boxside <- 16 for chrominence)

Use Q <- 87, Nf <- 30, Nd <- 128 (boxside <- 8 for luminence)

Examples of the output (with blacked out copied regions) of each of the test images are provided in this folder, as well.
