note: please do not use this algorithm (it is just for testingg and comparing PCA alone to robust PCA versions)
there are to many false negatives (or false positives depending on the number of quantization 
levels of PCA features or the input image).

Quantized DCT and Robust PCA in the other two folders seem to work perfect on the test images as specified.
