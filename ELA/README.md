# Error Level Analysis

Error Level Analysis can be used to localize image forgery since some parts of the image will have been saved at different quality factors. This is due to the different parts of the image having been subjected to the lossy compression multiple times or different levels of compression (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_level_analysis). (This works on any image type, but all non-jpeg images must be converted input to JPEG format before using.)

# Method
First the image is divided into 8Ã—8 blocks and each is recompressed independently at a known quality factor (such as 95%). 
The error level of an image is found from the amount of the loss in information when it is saved in the JPEG format 
(compressed). When measuring the error in the difference between the original image and the compressed image, 
each block should have approximately the same amount if the image is completely unmodified.
