#Error Level Analysis

When lossy compression is applied uniformly to an image we can see the uniform levels of compression artifacts. 
This is due to the different parts of the image having been subjected to the lossy compression multiple times or
different levels of compression (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_level_analysis).

#Method
First the image is divided into 8Ã—8 blocks and each is recompressed independently at a known quality factor (such as 95%). 
The error level of an image is found from the amount of the loss in information when it is saved in the JPEG format 
(compressed). When measuring the error in the difference between the original image and the compressed image, 
each block should have approximately the same amount if the image is completely unmodified.
