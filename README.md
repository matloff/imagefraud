# imagefraud

dctCPtested folder: contains a working DCT quantization algorithm (under the colder folder) for copy-paste image fraud,
as well as multiple test images and output (see README with subdirectory for more information)

pcaCProbust folder: contains a working combined intensity based and PCA algorithm (under the colder folder) for image fraud,
as well as multiple test images and output (see README with subdirectory for more information)
 
 - NOTE: please, use this code for testing as it is the fastest, easiest to use and most accurate

pcaCPtested folder: contains a test code for comparison of the use of just PCA features for copy-paste forgery detection 
(which has shown to not be as effective as other methods in our work and other research papers).
