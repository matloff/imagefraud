# imagefraud

dctCPtested folder: contains a working DCT quantization algorithm (under the colder folder) for copy-paste image fraud,
as well as multiple test images and output (see README with subdirectory for more information)

pcaCProbust folder: contains a working combined intensity based and PCA algorithm (under the colder folder) for image fraud,
as well as multiple test images and output (see README with subdirectory for more information)
 
 - NOTE: please, use this code for testing as it is the fastest, easiest to use and most accurate

pcaCPtested folder: contains a test code for comparison of the use of just PCA features for copy-paste forgery detection 
(which has shown to not be as effective as other methods in our work and other research papers).

A chroma-based method using Run Length Run Number (RLRN) encoding as well as SVM to detect any type of forgery based on the paper cited below will be added (within the next few days).
